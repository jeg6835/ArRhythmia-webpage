    <h1>Pulse: Live to Share</h1>
    <div class="text-blurb">
      <p>Pulse is a social media app for music lovers, created by Lawrence Johnson and Coz Fiore, with the goal of
        turning the current mobile site into a fully functional mobile application. The app combines Spotify and Apple
        Music libraries into one platform where users can share and discover music in a social media form. The MVP for a
        cloud-native mobile application will be developed by a team of engineers, with additional features such as push
        notifications added. The scope of the project includes user profile creation, the ability to follow other users,
        search music through APIs, post comments, and access music through Spotify or Apple. The project also includes a
        subscription-based system with daily push notifications and a plan to use AI algorithms to predict user
        preferences. The main challenges in developing the app include creating a hybrid mobile app with push
        notifications, utilizing APIs, designing a cloud-based architecture, and managing users and subscriptions.</p>
